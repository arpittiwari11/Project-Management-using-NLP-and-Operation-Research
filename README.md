# Project-Management-using-NLP-and-Operation-Research

We worked on this project for the duration of 4 months. The problem statement was the allocation of issues to the available coders present in the company for the particular project.
The issues were in the textual form and contained textual information ie. the summary and the description of the issues. Our main philosophy while allocating the issues to the developers in to find a developers which has highest relevancy or similarity in doingf that particular task. And this information is extracted from the tasks did by the coder in his previous stay in the company.

We combined the State of the art method of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and SVM (Support Vector Machines) for finding the relevance scores.
We combined Machine Learning with Operation Research later for allocating the resources efficiently in order to maximise the relevance under the given constraints in the company operations like taking into account the capabilities of the coders to do the number of tasks at a particular time.
Time it takes to complete a particular issues and hence minimising time taken at the same time, etc.
